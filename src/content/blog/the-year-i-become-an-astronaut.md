Not the astronaut who endures a decade of training, gets strapped into a rocket, and survives in the most inhospitable environment known to humankind.

I'm embarking on a different kind of space mission: mastering [Astro.build](https://astro.build/).

Astro, a term increasingly mentioned in the web development cosmos in 2023, piqued my curiosity after [Brad Traversy](https://www.traversymedia.com/) launched his [Astro Quick Start Course on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoIHKO6AkoM). Brad, a guiding star in the world of web development education, has a knack for making complex and new concepts accessible.

In the ever-evolving universe of web technologies, we find ourselves both exhilarated and, at times, overwhelmed. My strategy against the tidal wave of new information? Adopting an atomic approach to learning and development. Full disclosure: it's not a foolproof method, but embracing the occasional stumble is part of the journey!

**So, what's the game plan?**

I aim to chronicle my expedition into building a site with Astro through a series of posts. These will not just be a log of steps taken, but a reflection of insights gained, challenges faced, and solutions discovered.

Since there will be a good amount of trial and error, the first project I’ll be working on is this very site. As you might have noticed, it's a bit plain at the moment. But that's just the starting point of our journey. As we navigate through this expedition, you'll witness this site transforming, evolving with each new discovery and breakthrough we make. 

If you would like to follow along with the source code you can find it [here](https://github.com/john-rock/johnrock-astro).

**Why Astro, you ask?**

Astro represents a new frontier in web development, promising efficient loading times and an enhanced developer experience. It's like having a spaceship that's light yet powerful, perfect for exploring the vast expanse of modern web development.

Stay tuned as I strap on my space boots and venture into this new realm. Let's explore the potential of Astro together – no space suit required!
